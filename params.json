Installing this package is just copying the folder containing \r\nBioGAP into the pkg/ folder of GAP.\r\n\r\nPackage dependencies: SgpDec (https://github.com/gap-system/sgpdec),\r\n                      Dust (https://github.com/egri-nagy/dust).\r\n\r\nIf you use this package in your research please cite BioGAP as:\r\n\r\nAttila Egri-Nagy, Andrew R. Francis, Volker Gebhardt,\r\nBacterial Genomics and Computational Group Theory: The BioGAP Package for GAP,\r\nICMS 2014, LNCS 8592, pp. 67â€“74, 2014.\r\n\r\nAlso, for the 2-inversion model:\r\n\r\nAttila Egri-Nagy, Volker Gebhardt, Mark M.
