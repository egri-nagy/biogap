# BioGAP

A GAP4 package for abstract algebraic algorithms in bacterial genomics.
The current implementation contains methods for

* dealing with signed permutations,
* calculating the word distance in different group models,
* computing the graded interval of all geodesics between two group elements.

The GAP system is available from www.gap-system.org. Installing this package is just copying the folder containing 
BioGAP into the pkg/ folder of GAP.

Package dependencies: SgpDec (https://github.com/gap-system/sgpdec),
                      Dust (https://github.com/egri-nagy/dust).
